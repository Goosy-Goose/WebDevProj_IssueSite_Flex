                <p><b>There is a difference between AI art generators and AI tools for art.</b> <br><br>
                    The magic wand tool in Adobe Photoshop is an example of an AI tool that allows artists to
                    select entire objects. An artist might use the magic wand tool to select the sky, a boulder, 
                    or even a person's shadow.
                    <br><br>The difference between that and AI generated art is that machine learning is only used to identify
                    certain selections. From there, the artist is free to manipulate the selection as they see fit, whereas an 
                    AI art generator would immediately fill the canvas in with something no human had any input on.

            <div class="content_text">
                <p>AI art generators have to get trained off of something. That something is other artists' artwork.
                    <Br><br>Nearly every single time, the artist has <b>not consented</b> to having their artwork used to train
                    these art generators. Artists have already begun to fight back in a <a href="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/">
                    class action lawsuit</a> against AI art generators like Midjourney and Deviantart.
                    <br><br>This <b>unethical collection of training data</b> is something to keep in mind anytime you use 
                    an AI art generator, especially if you specify "in a specific artists artstyle".

                    Artists who run <b>small businesses</b> to earn their livelihoods based on their passions end up 
                    <b>losing clients</b> to cheaper AI art.
                    <br><br>Art takes time. Artists practicing the craft can take <b>years upon years</b> to develop a style that they are 
                    happy with. Each piece has an elaborate thought process to it. Each stroke has a meaning. (Look at digital artists and 
                    how they press undo 20 times before being happy with a single stroke.) AI <b>devalues the time and effort</b> these artists put in 
                    developing their own style and steals it within seconds, collaging a piece of artwork in the time between you pressing enter 
                    and an art piece to popping up on your screen.
