                <p><b>Pros:</b> <br>- Quickly create art without much skill. <br><br>
                    - Create wholly unique artwork. <br><br>
                    - Costs minimal money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Cons: (not including ethical issues)</b> <br><br>
                    - bby all you did was type words. The words is the art, not the image. (Completion of artwork is not as fulfilling) <br><br>
                    - Homogeneous art styles.<br><br>
                    - AI generated artwork is not copyrighted.

                <p>A <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-works-not-copyrightable-studios-1235570316/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>
                    article articulates that AI generated art is non-copyrightable, and therefore in the public domain for free use. 
                    <br><br> So please <b>do not sell AI Art</b>. Obviously you could just not tell anyone that the artwork you're selling is AI,
                    but, dipping slightly into ethics, selling free things for money is just kind of scummy :(.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps consider using AI generated art to <b>inspire your own artwork</b> whether that be visual, audio, or other.
                    AI models are able to reach a much more varied set of references than you and will mash them together in a unique 
                    way. AI generated art can provide distinctly new ideas for you to draw from.
